Global description: **This entity models a particular vehicle model, including all properties which are common to multiple vehicle instances belonging to such model.**  


## List of properties  


- `address`: The mailing address  
- `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  
- `annotations`: Annotations about the item  
- `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  
- `cargoWeight`: Current weight of the vehicle's cargo  
- `category`: Vehicle category(ies) from an external point of view. This is different than the vehicle type (car, lorry, etc.) represented by the `vehicleType` property. Enum:'municipalServices, nonTracked, private, public, specialUsage, tracked'. Tracked vehicles are those vehicles which position is permanently tracked by a remote system. Or any other needed by an application They incorporate a GPS receiver together with a network connection to periodically update a reported position (location, speed, heading ...).  
- `color`: The color of the product  
- `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  
- `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  
- `dateFirstUsed`: Timestamp which denotes when the vehicle was first used  
- `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  
- `dateVehicleFirstRegistered`: The date of the first registration of the vehicle with the respective public authorities  
- `description`: A description of this item  
- `feature`: Feature(s) incorporated by the vehicle. Enum:' abs, airbag, alarm, backCamera, disabledRamp, gps, internetConnection, overspeed, proximitySensor, wifi'. Or any other needed by the application. In order to represent multiple instances of a feature it can be used the following syntax: `<feature>,<occurences>`. For example, a car with 4 airbags will be represented by `airbag,4`.  
- `fleetVehicleId`: The identifier of the vehicle in the context of the fleet of vehicles to which it belongs  
- `heading`: Denotes the direction of travel of the vehicle and is specified in decimal degrees, where 0 <= `heading` < 360, counting clockwise relative to the true north. If the vehicle is stationary (i.e. the value of the `speed` attribute is `0`), then the value of the heading attribute must be equal to `-1`  
- `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  
- `image`: An image of the item  
- `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  
- `mileageFromOdometer`: The total distance travelled by the particular vehicle since its initial production, as read from its odometer  
- `name`: The name of this item.  
- `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  
- `previousLocation`:   
- `purchaseDate`: The date the item e.g. vehicle was purchased by the current owner  
- `refVehicleModel`: Reference to a VehicleModel  
- `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  
- `serviceProvided`: Service(s) the vehicle is capable of providing or it is assigned to. Enum:'auxiliaryServices, cargoTransport, construction, fairground, garbageCollection, goodsSelling, maintenance, parksAndGardens, roadSignalling, specialTransport, streetCleaning, streetLighting, urbanTransit, wasteContainerCleaning'. Or any other value needed by an specific application.  
- `serviceStatus`: Vehicle status (from the point of view of the service provided, so it could not apply to private vehicles). `parked` : Vehicle is parked and not providing any service at the moment. `onRoute` : Vehicle is performing a mission. A comma-separated modifier(s) can be added to indicate what mission is currently delivering the vehicle. For instance `onRoute,garbageCollection` can be used to denote that the vehicle is on route and in a garbage collection mission. `broken` : Vehicle is suffering a temporary breakdown. `outOfService` : Vehicle is on the road but not performing any mission, probably going to its parking area. Enum:'broken, onRoute, outOfService, parked'  
- `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  
- `speed`: Denotes the magnitude of the horizontal component of the vehicle's current velocity and is specified in Kilometers per Hour. If provided, the value of the speed attribute must be a non-negative real number. `-1` MAY be used if speed is transiently unknown for some reason  
- `type`: NGSI Entity type. It has to be Vehicle  
- `vehicleConfiguration`: A short text indicating the configuration of the vehicle, e.g. '5dr hatchback ST 2.5 MT 225 hp' or 'limited edition'  
- `vehicleIdentificationNumber`: The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a unique serial number used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles  
- `vehiclePlateIdentifier`:  An identifier or code displayed on a vehicle registration plate attached to the vehicle used for official identification purposes. The registration identifier is numeric or alphanumeric and is unique within the issuing authority's region. Normative References: DATEXII `vehicleRegistrationPlateIdentifier`  
- `vehicleSpecialUsage`: Indicates whether the vehicle is been used for special purposes, like commercial rental, driving school, or as a taxi. The legislation in many countries requires this information to be revealed when offering a car for sale. Enum:'ambulance, fireBrigade, military, police, schoolTransportation, taxi'  
- `vehicleType`: Type of vehicle from the point of view of its structural characteristics. This is different than the vehicle category . Enum:'agriculturalVehicle, anyVehicle, articulatedVehicle, bicycle, binTrolley, bus, car, caravan, carOrLightVehicle, carWithCaravan, carWithTrailer, cleaningTrolley, constructionOrMaintenanceVehicle, fourWheelDrive, highSidedVehicle, lorry, minibus, moped, motorcycle, motorcycleWithSideCar, motorscooter, sweepingMachine, tanker, threeWheeledVehicle, trailer, tram, twoWheeledVehicle, trolley, van, vehicleWithoutCatalyticConverter, vehicleWithCaravan, vehicleWithTrailer, withEvenNumberedRegistrationPlates, withOddNumberedRegistrationPlates, other'.

## Example payloads    

#### Vehicle NGSI-v2 key-values Example    

Here is an example of a Vehicle in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  

```json

#### Vehicle NGSI-LD key-values Example    

Here is an example of a Vehicle in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  

```json  

{  
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Vehicle:vehicle:WasteManagement:1",  
  "type": "Vehicle",  
  "category": {  
    "type": "Property",  
    "value": [  
      "municipalServices"  
    ]  
  },  
  "vehicleType": {  
    "type": "Property",  
    "value": "lorry"  
  },  
  "name": {  
    "type": "Property",  
    "value": "C Recogida 1"  
  },  
  "vehiclePlateIdentifier": {  
    "type": "Property",  
    "value": "3456ABC"  
  },  
  "refVehicleModel": {  
    "type": "Relationship",  
    "object": "urn:ngsi-ld:VehicleModel:vehiclemodel:econic"  
  },  
  "location": {

      "coordinates": [  
        -3.164485591715449,  
        40.62785133667262  
      ]  
    },  
    "observedAt": "2018-09-27T12:00:00Z"  
  },  
  "areaServed": {  
    "type": "Property",

    "observedAt": "2018-09-27T12:00:00Z"  
  },  
  "serviceProvided": {  
    "type": "Property",

  ]  
}  
```  

#### Vehicle NGSI-LD normalized Example    

Here is an example of a Vehicle in JSON-LD format as normalized. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when not using options and returns the context data of an individual entity.  

```json  

{  
  "@context": [  
    "https://smartdatamodels.org/context.jsonld",  
    "https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"  
  ],  
  "areaServed": "Centro",  
  "cargoWeight": 314,  
  "category": [  
    "municipalServices"  
  ],  
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Vehicle:vehicle:WasteManagement:1",  
  "location": {  
    "coordinates": [  
      -3.164485591715449,  
      40.62785133667262  
    ],  
    "type": "Point"  
  },  
  "name": "C Recogida 1",  
  "refVehicleModel": "urn:ngsi-ld:VehicleModel:vehiclemodel:econic",  
  "serviceProvided": [  
    "gargabeCollection",  
    "wasteContainerCleaning"  
  ],  
  "serviceStatus": "onRoute",  
  "speed": 50,  
  "type": "Vehicle",  
  "vehiclePlateIdentifier": "3456ABC",  
  "vehicleType": "lorry"  
}  
```
